Windows users
Windows users can log in using PuTTY utility. The following are the steps:

Download, and install the PuTTY utility suite in your Windows machine from https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html .
You will need to have your PuTTY Private Key (.ppk) file locally. For this reason, we will use PuTTYgen utility to convert the .pem file to .ppk format.
Run the PuTTYgen in your machine.
Click Load, as shown in the snapshot below.
Browse and load the .pem key into the PuTTYgen and then click on Save private key to save the key in .ppk format without a passphrase.


Run the PuTTY to connect to the EC2 instance.
Get the public DNS / IP address of your EC2 instance (host) from your AWS EC2 dashboard. Then, enter the public DNS / IP address of your EC2 instance (host) into the PuTTY . See snapshot below.

Click on Connection → Data to enter the default username as ubuntu for Ubuntu, or ec2-user for Linux based OS. The list of default usernames are listed here
Click on Connection → SSH → Auth to upload the .ppk file. See the snapshot below:

If everything is set up correctly, a terminal window would open up to log you into your Linux/Ubuntu EC2 instance.
