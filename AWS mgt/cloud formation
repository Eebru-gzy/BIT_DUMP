Cloud Formation
AWS Cloud Formation allows you to model your entire infrastructure in a text file template allowing you to provision AWS resources based on the scripts you write.

Tips
Cloud Formation is found under the Management & Governance section on the AWS Management Console.
Cloud Formation templates are written using JSON or YAML.
You can still individually manage AWS resources that are part of a CloudFormation stack.
