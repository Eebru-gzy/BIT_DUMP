Definition - A network access control list (ACL) defines the set of firewall rules for controlling traffic coming in and out of subnets in your VPC.

You can view the Network ACLs under the Security section in the left navigation pane of the VPC Dashboard. See a snapshot below:


Snaphot: VPC Dashboard â†’ Network ACLs

The details of the items highlighted in red in the snapshot above are:

1. List of Network ACLs
For each Network ACL in the list, view the ID, the count of associated subnets, whether it is a Default, the VPC Id to whom the network ACL is associated, and the owner ID.

2. Details of the Selected Network ACL
View the details of the selected Network ACL. In the snapshot above, it shows the details of a default Network ACL. Note that each VPC automatically gets associated with a modifiable default network ACL. Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with any one network ACL. Whereas, a given network ACL can be associated with multiple subnets.

Inbound/Outbound Rules
The default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic, as shown in the snapshot above. However, you can create or edit the rules, anytime.
Inbound/Outbound rules are numbered and ordered. The lowest numbered rule is evaluated first. In other words, the incoming/outgoing traffic to/from a given subnet follows the rules mentioned in the associated network ACL.
Network ACLs are stateless in nature. Assume an inbound request arrived in your subnet. A "response" to the inbound request can only be sent out of the subnet if the outbound rules allow the outgoing traffic to the desired destination. A vice-versa scenario is also possible.
