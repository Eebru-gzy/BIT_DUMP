AWS Shield
AWS Shield is a managed DDoS (or Distributed Denial of Service) protection service that safeguards web applications running on AWS. AWS Shield offers two tiers of protection - Standard and Advanced.

Standard tier: Standard AWS Shield is a service that you get "out of the box", it is always running (automatically) and is a part of the free standard tier.
Advanced tier: If you want to use some of the more advanced features, you'll have to utilize the paid tier.
The standard AWS Shield Standard is always-on, using techniques to detect malicious traffic.
